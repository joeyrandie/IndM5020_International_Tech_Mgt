## Career Goals

IndM 5020 International Technology Mangement has prepared me for reaching my long-termr goal to become a Director
of an Information Technology company. I am now able to understand what goes into starting and expanding an global corporation. In 
class we were able to identify problems with international technology management and find solutions that could promote more 
efficient business processes. We could use these in real world scenarios and this is why IndM 5020 has helped my knowledge grow.
